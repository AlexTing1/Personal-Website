This was a solo project where I created a website that would allow users to upload photos of puppies and rank them based on cuteness.
Afterward, the users can click on the scoreboard button to see the current rankings of puppies in the system.
In addtion to rankings, MMR ranking and image of each puppy will be shown.
Rankings can be viewed globally or locally. MMR rankings are created using the standard elo-rating system.

const twitterSent = `
This was a solo project where I created an web app that conducts sentiment analysis on a selected user's Twitter Account. The app would scan the user's
tweets and then conduct sentiment analysis to determine if the tweet had positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The application would then return
this information in the format of a doughnut graph. In addition to that, the application would graph the number of tweets, retweets,and likes in a certain timeframe,
and also display a users most commonly used words in a word cloud.
