const puppyRanker = `
This was a solo project where I created a website that would allow users to upload photos of puppies and rank them based on cuteness.
Afterward, the users can view the rankings and MMR ranking of each puppy submitted into the system.

I used React to create the front end of the website, and MongoDB as the database to store the website's information.
I used the MongoDB package gridfs to allow image file uploads to MongoDB database and this was a great experience in learning new packages and applying them to my own projects.
